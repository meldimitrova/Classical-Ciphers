# Classical Ciphers

A simple project on classical cryptography written in Java to perform encryption and decryption of Caesar Cipher, Atbash Cipher, Vigenere Cipher and Playfair Cipher. The application implements different features of Java to perform the specific techniques used for each of these classical ciphers.

The program takes an example plaintext for the testing of all ciphers. Further, a File reader was used to read into two custom txt files that are used as the plaintext.

I explored the topic of classical cryptography in vast detail for my Honours project where I worked under the topic "Teaching Tool for the Cryptanalysis of Classical Ciphers."
